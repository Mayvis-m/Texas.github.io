                    <h2>About Austin</h2>
                    <p>Located in Central Texas on the eastern edge of the American Southwest, 
                        Austin is the capital of the state of Texas, the Lone Star State.
                        The city dates back to the 1830s, when the first Anglo-American settlers arrived in the area, then part of Mexico.
                        Austin is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is considered a Gamma-level global 
                        city as categorized by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
                        There's a reason Austin is often ranked one of the fittest cities in the country. 
                        From cycling and hiking to leisurely stand-up paddle boarding and kayaking - Austin offers an abundance of outdoor activities. 
                        And with nearly 300 days of sunshine and an average temperature of 68 degrees, being active in Austin comes naturally. 
                        Whether it's a sunset bat cruise on Lady Bird Lake, a stroll along the Butler Hike and Bike Trail, or a dip in Austin's 
                        beloved Barton Springs Pool make sure "fun outdoors" makes it on your Austin itinerary.</p>
